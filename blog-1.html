    <h1>The Sisyphean Effort of Module 1</h1>
      <p>It may seem like hyperbole, but Module 1 at times gave me more sympathy for Sisyphus, cursed to roll a heavy boulder up a hill every day only to have it roll right back down for him to do it again the next day. Putting it that way may seem like I hated my time, but that couldn't be further from the truth.</p>

      <p>So far at Turing I've had my perceptions of myself and situations shattered and rebuilt. I used to think I knew how to handle stress and working with people because in kitchens, (where most of my work experience is), its high stress and the real person comes through much faster, but quite a bit more coarse. Getting to know my own working style in a new language was strange and difficult on its own. There was a heavy <em>emphasis</em> on collaboration. Through every bit of collaboration with people in my cohort I learned something, whether it was about the curriculum, different people's working styles, or as corny as it sounds, about myself.</p>

      <p>My favorite technical concept covered in Module 1 curriculum would have to have been modules. Mixin modules to be more specific. I'm a big fan of keeping my code D.R.Y. (don't repeat yourself) and being able to call a method just using its name in the Class includes the Module. A close second would be hashes. They started out scary, but after getting more familiar with them I realized how amazingly useful they are for storing sorted data. </p>
