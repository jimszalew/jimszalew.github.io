    <h2>The Sisyphean Effort of Module 1</h2>
      <p>It may seem like hyperbole, but Module 1 at times gave me more sympathy for Sisyphus, cursed to roll a heavy boulder up a hill every day only to have it roll right back down for him to do it again the next day. Putting it that way may seem like I hated my time, but that couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
