    <h3>Mod 1 highlights (if you don't feel like reading my blog)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Turing has been a great experience in learning how to learn and self sufficiency</li>
      <li>Teamwork makes the dreamwork (cliches are played out for a reason)</li>
      <li>Misconceptions lurk around every corner, ditching assumptions is a wonderful practice</li>
      <li>It's okay to not know something, I'll figure it out eventually</li>
    </ul>
